I am a Lecturer at the School of Science at RMIT University, holding a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics. My research interests include Cyber Mathematics, Biometrics, Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning, and Children's Online Safety.

I have developed the first privacy-preserving retinal recognition system and created the first large-scale high-quality synthetic retinal image dataset using data-driven generative modelling. My contributions have earned numerous awards for research excellence, innovative teaching, and community outreach.

I am passionate about research, teaching, and industry collaboration. Outside of work, I enjoy coffee, ice-skating, and learning Chinese.
